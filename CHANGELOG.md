### Fixed
- **Major Compilation Issues Resolved** (86% success rate - 37 of 43 errors fixed):
  - âœ… Timer namespace ambiguity resolved (`System.Threading.Timer`)
  - âœ… Fixed 15+ instances of `LogInfo` â†’ `LogInformation` method calls
  - âœ… Corrected SimpleLogger constructor calls with required `LogLevel` parameter
  - âœ… Updated ConfigurationManager constructor calls with logger parameter
  - âœ… Fixed RhinoGet.GetString API calls to use `Rhino.Input.Custom.GetString`
  - âœ… Corrected GetOption API calls with proper namespace (`Rhino.Input.Custom.GetOption`)
  - âœ… Resolved async/await issues by wrapping calls in `Task.Run`
  - âœ… Fixed Environment.ProcessId compatibility using `System.Diagnostics.Process.GetCurrentProcess().Id`
  - âœ… Resolved namespace conflicts between AI and Core components
  - âœ… Fixed ambiguous ContextManager references with explicit namespacing
  - âœ… Enhanced TestingFramework with proper constructor calls
  - âœ… Removed redundant `Core/NLPProcessor.cs` wrapper to eliminate circular dependencies
